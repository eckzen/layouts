Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each class is for:

- wrapper - Sets the perspective and scroll properties for the whole page.

- section - Size, display, and text properties. Mostly not relevant to the parallax effect.

- static - Adds a background to a section, just for demonstration.

- parallax - Adds an ::after pseudo-element with the background image and transforms needed for the parallax effect.

- bg1, .bg2 - Adds the respective background images for each section. (You could use an img tag instead.)
